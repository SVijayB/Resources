# Vim Commands

If you haven't already tried vimtutor, you should do so. It helps you learn all the basic commands needed to get started with Vim. But if you choose not to, I have mentioned all the commands needed below. 

### Cursor Movement

* **j** to go one row down 
* **k** to go one row up 
* **l** to go one character right
* **h** to go one character left

You can add a number at the beginning of these commands, like `4j`or `5l`.This would execute the command by the number mentioned. That is, 4j would move the cursor 4 rows down. and 5l would move the cursor 5 characters to the right.

### Moving between words

* **w** moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
* **e** moves the the cursor to the end of the word.
* **b** moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.

**Note** : You can execute the same command multiple times by adding a number at the beginning. Using the Upper case of each of these commands also work. They go to the word mentioned before or after a white-space.
