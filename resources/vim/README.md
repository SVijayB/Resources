### What is Vim?

Vim is a text editor, Just like every other text editors. Like your Notepad, Sublime Text, or Atom, It is just another software/tool that allows you to write and edit text or code.

### Why Use Vim?

The main key feature of vim that makes it so different from other text editors are its amazing keyboard shortcuts and its efficiency. 

Most often we tend to edit our existing code than actually write new lines. One software update after another we tend to overwrite existing lines of code and content. And that is where vim allows you to be more efficient.

It allows you to be efficient by giving you the feature to use only your keyboard. It also allows you to use custom keyboard shortcuts to edit and move through lines of code in a matter of seconds. This means, you don't have to move your mouse every time you want to edit a line or switch to a different line.

The other reason is that it is available on literally every platform out there. Be it windows, Mac or Linux.
