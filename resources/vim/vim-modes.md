# Vim Modes

Once you have installed the Vim extension on VS Code, you can notice in the bottom the mode you are using. Namely Insert, Normal, Command, Visual and Replace Mode.

### Normal Mode

By Default, you will be on the normal mode on VS Code or your Vim Editor. You can access this mode by simply pressing the `Esc` key.
