## What is GitHub?

At its heart, GitHub is a collaboration platform.  
 From software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.

## What is VCS?

GitHub uses Git, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor to your project--so you know exactly where every line of code came from.

## What you are going to learn

* Committing 
* Deleting Changes
* Branching

## Simple cmd commands you might need :

```text
cd ..                        # Goes up a folder
cd directoryname             # Enters the folder
mkdir foldername             # Creates a folder
echo >> filename.format      # Creates a file
notepad filename.format      # Opens the file in notepad
rm filename.format           # Deletes the file
rmdir foldername             # Deletes the folder
```
