# Miscellaneous

After creating a release on GitHub, you have to update the tags on your local repository. To do so, use : 

```text
git fetch --tags -f
```

### Git Stash

Sometimes, when you are working on a feature but you have a more pressing issue to deal with, you can use Git Stash. It is used to save changes that you are not ready to commit yet and hence gives you a clean working tree to pull or push changes.
